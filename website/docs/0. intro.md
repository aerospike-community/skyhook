# Skyhook

[![Build](https://github.com/aerospike/skyhook/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/aerospike/skyhook/actions/workflows/build.yml)

Skyhook is a Redis API-compatible gateway to the [Aerospike](https://www.aerospike.com/) Database. Use Skyhook to quickly get your Redis client applications up and running on an Aerospike cluster.

## Overview

Skyhook is designed as a standalone server application written in Kotlin, which
accepts Redis protocol commands and projects them to an Aerospike cluster using
the Aerospike Java client under the hood. It uses [Netty](https://netty.io/) as
a non-blocking I/O client-server framework.

This project is now in **beta**. If you're an enterprise customer feel free to
reach out to our support with feedback and feature requests.
We appreciate feedback from the Aerospike community on
[issues](https://github.com/aerospike/skyhook/issues)
related to Skyhook.

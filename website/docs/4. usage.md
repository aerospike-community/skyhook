# Usage With Redis client

## Connectivity

Any Redis client can connect to Skyhook as if it were a regular Redis server.

For tests purposes use [redis-cli](https://redis.io/topics/rediscli) or the [nc](https://www.commandlinux.com/man-page/man1/nc.1.html) (or netcat) utility:

```sh
echo "GET key1\r\n" | nc localhost 6379
```


## Known Limitations

* A partial but growing list of Redis commands. See [Redis Command Coverage](#redis-command-coverage).
* By default, an Aerospike namespace does not allow for TTLs. Read [more](https://discuss.aerospike.com/t/faq-what-are-expiration-eviction-and-stop-writes/2311) on how to set up expiration and eviction support.
* Like Redis Cluster, Skyhook supports a single Redis 'database 0', which maps to a single namespace and set in the Aerospike Database.
* Will not try to implement the cluster operations sub-commands of `CLUSTER`, `CLIENT`, `CONFIG`,  `MEMORY`, `MONITOR`, `LATENCY`.
* No support for Pub/Sub commands.
* No support for Lua scripts.

# Supported Redis Commands

## Known Limitations

- By default, an Aerospike namespace does not allow for TTLs. Read [more](https://discuss.aerospike.com/t/faq-what-are-expiration-eviction-and-stop-writes/2311) on how to set up expiration and eviction support.
- Like Redis Cluster, Skyhook supports a single Redis 'database 0', which maps to a single namespace and set in the Aerospike Database.
- Will not try to implement the cluster operations sub-commands of `CLUSTER`, `CLIENT`, `CONFIG`, `MEMORY`, `MONITOR`, `LATENCY`.
- No support for Pub/Sub commands.
- No support for Lua scripts.
